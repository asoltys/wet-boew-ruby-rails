# Web Experience Toolkit (WET) -- Ruby on Rails Framework Variant

This project is intended to provide a basic Ruby on Rails application that has been modified to incorporate the Government of Canada WET Core Framework and CLF 2.0 theme.  This has been accomplished by using the __rails new__ command to generate a default Rails application skeleton and creating a layout file based off the HTML5 template from the WET CLF 2.0 theme but with rails-style directives being used to include javascripts and stylesheets and to yield content and navigation.

If you are interested in following or contributing to this project, or have questions or feedback, please contact [Adam Soltys](mailto:adam.soltys@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca)
